# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# 20.times do 
#   Word.create(word_name: "desert", definition: "affected with disease or ill health : ailing", etymology: "Middle English, from Anglo-French, from Late Latin {it}desertum{/it}, from Latin, neuter {it}desertus{/it}, past participle of {it}deserere{/it} to desert, from {it}de-{/it} {it}serere{/it} to join together {ma}{mat|series|}{/ma}")
